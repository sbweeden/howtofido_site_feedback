# howtofido_site_feedback

A repo for tracking UX feedback and issues on https://howtofido.securitypoc.com

The site linked above is a prototype / realization of scenarios documented in the [How To FIDO](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cYu904oU2KNhyAjZNUiS4Gb_PpDewKpIb8l7xRcGdm0) prescriptive adoption pattern for FIDO relying parties.

The goal of the site and the doc is to educate relying party developers and bring first-class, consistent authentication experiences to consumers.
